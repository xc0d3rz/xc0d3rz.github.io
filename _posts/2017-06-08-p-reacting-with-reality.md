**Imagine that you're returning home after a difficult day by bus and someone next to you was saying shit, How can you make him stop burning your mind ?**
- If you are a murderer, Just kill him or if were a programmer, Like me I'd like to write a piece of code in order to stop him.
That's what we will learn.
## Seem to be impossible ?
We all know that the programming environment is limited, So how we can control the reality programmatically.

### **What about an Interpreter embedded in humans ?**
**Yes, I am taking about [Microchip implant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microchip_implant_(human)).**

The Microchip has the ability to communicate with and control neurons and  contains a unique ID number that can be linked remotely to receive a piece of code which been executed in our minds.

- The diagram below explain what I mean

### Resource of the Idea
1. [Gamer(film)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamer_(film))
2. [Mind Control Brain Implants - Targeted Individuals(video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SvezIOQZpQ)
3. My life problems


### The end of story
- I believe, oneday programmers will have the ability to control everything by coding.
- Thanks goes to my `Mental patient `
